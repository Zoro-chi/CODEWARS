// KATA FOR WEDNESDAY, 23/3/2022


// Description:

// Simple, remove the spaces from the string, then return the resultant string.


// My Solution:

function noSpace(x){
  return x.split(" ").join("")
}

// My Notes on Kata :

// This was a lot easier to work through than the 7 kyu I did earlier 
// I feel to be more efficient on learning i should continue the fundamentals till i feel more comfortable.
// This took me 6 mins to pass. More work to be done.
